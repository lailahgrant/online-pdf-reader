### Tools used

### Where & Why use the above tool 
- Photoshop yo resize my images in different dimensions (w*h):- 
	- 500*650  
	- 76*100
	- 1115*1443
- I like to use Visual Studio Code to push code on github.
- Sublime text is like my very 1st goto editor for quick start.
- Google for research on a new technology, bug solution etc.
-  the Internet to push code on github.
-  Netlify is free platform where you can deploy your frontend work, get an online link you can always share with other e.g. potfolio.netlify.com (dummy link) 
    - it is always best to connect your github to your Netlify account(signup using Github)

`  So far  so good, this is my 2nd time doing this and this time it is much easier actually. `
